# Ethical Considerations

This project was conducted strictly as an **educational phishing awareness simulation**
using the GoPhish framework. Ethical responsibility and user safety were prioritized
throughout the design and execution of the campaign.

---

## Scope and Intent
- The purpose of this project was **awareness and learning**, not real-world exploitation.
- The simulation demonstrates common phishing techniques to understand user behavior
  and highlight the importance of cybersecurity awareness.

---

## Controlled Environment
- All testing was performed in a **local, controlled environment**.
- Only test email accounts were used.
- No real organization, company, or production system was targeted.

---

## Data Handling
- **No real credentials were collected or stored**.
- Form submissions were used only to record interaction events (clicks/submissions).
- Sensitive information such as passwords was explicitly not retained.

---

## Email and Identity Usage
- Sender identities and email content were used **solely for simulation purposes**.
- Public documentation replaces real or brand-specific sender identities with
  **generic, non-real addresses** to avoid impersonation.
- The project does not encourage misuse of phishing techniques.

---

## Participant Awareness
- The simulation was designed to demonstrate phishing mechanics rather than deceive users.
- Post-interaction redirection was used to safely terminate the phishing flow and
  reinforce awareness.

---

## Compliance and Responsibility
- The project aligns with ethical guidelines for cybersecurity education.
- No laws, policies, or terms of service were intentionally violated.
- The repository does not contain sensitive data, credentials, or exploitable assets.

## Disclaimer
This project is intended **only for educational and awareness purposes**.
The techniques demonstrated should be used responsibly and only in environments
where explicit permission has been granted.
